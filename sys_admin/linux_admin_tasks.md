Awesome question — and super important if you're diving into Linux or system administration as a career! Here's a breakdown of what **Linux System Administrators** typically do **day-to-day** (or week-to-week), based on real-world roles in both small and large environments.

---

## 👨‍💻 Daily / Routine Tasks of a Linux Administrator

---

### 🧩 **1. System Monitoring & Health Checks**

- Check system **CPU**, **memory**, **disk usage**, and **load**:
  ```bash
  top, htop, free, df -h, uptime
  ```
- Review **logs** for errors or unusual behavior:
  ```bash
  journalctl, /var/log/messages, /var/log/secure
  ```
- Use monitoring tools like **Nagios**, **Zabbix**, **Prometheus**, or **Grafana**.

---

### 🔐 **2. User & Permission Management**

- Create or delete users:
  ```bash
  useradd, userdel, passwd
  ```
- Set file permissions and ownership:
  ```bash
  chmod, chown, groups
  ```
- Manage sudo access:
  ```bash
  visudo
  ```

---

### 💾 **3. Disk & Filesystem Management**

- Check disk space:
  ```bash
  df -h, du -sh
  ```
- Mount/unmount disks, manage partitions (`lsblk`, `fdisk`, `mount`, `fstab`)
- Monitor and expand LVM volumes if needed

---

### 🔄 **4. Patch Management & Updates**

- Check for and apply software/security updates:
  ```bash
  dnf update, dnf updateinfo list security
  ```
- Test updates on staging before applying to production
- Keep kernel and critical packages up to date

---

### 🌐 **5. Network Configuration & Troubleshooting**

- Check IP address, hostname, routes:
  ```bash
  ip a, ip r, hostnamectl
  ```
- Troubleshoot DNS, SSH, and connectivity:
  ```bash
  ping, traceroute, nslookup, dig, netstat, ss
  ```

---

### 🧰 **6. Service and Process Management**

- Start/stop/restart services:
  ```bash
  systemctl status nginx
  systemctl restart sshd
  ```
- Check running processes:
  ```bash
  ps aux, top
  ```

---

### 🧪 **7. Automation & Scripting**

- Write **Bash scripts** for tasks like backups, monitoring, user creation
- Automate cron jobs:
  ```bash
  crontab -e
  ```
- Use tools like **Ansible** or **Puppet** for large-scale automation

---

### 🧱 **8. Backup & Restore**

- Ensure backups are running (e.g., using `rsync`, `tar`, backup software)
- Perform or test restores when needed
- Schedule backup verification

---

### 🔐 **9. Security & Access Control**

- Monitor failed login attempts:
  ```bash
  cat /var/log/secure
  ```
- Configure firewalls (e.g., `firewalld`, `iptables`)
- Keep systems hardened (disable unused ports/services, update SSH config)

---

### 🔧 **10. Troubleshooting & Support**

- Respond to tickets or alerts for:
  - System slowness
  - Application errors
  - Disk full
  - Failed services
- Collaborate with devs and other teams

---

## 🗂️ Weekly or Monthly Tasks

- Review audit and compliance reports
- Plan capacity upgrades (RAM, storage)
- Patch testing and deployment cycles
- Review backups and DR strategy
- Participate in on-call rotations

---

## 🛠️ Common Tools They Use

- **Command-line tools** (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `find`, `vi`, etc.)
- **SystemD** for service management
- **SSH** for remote administration
- **Monitoring tools** (Nagios, Zabbix, etc.)
- **Configuration management** (Ansible, Puppet, Chef)
- **Version control** (Git, especially for scripts or config management)
- **Ticketing systems** (Jira, ServiceNow)
