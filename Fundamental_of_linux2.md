The `more` and `less` commands in Linux are both used to view the contents of text files in the terminal, but they differ in functionality and usability. Here's the breakdown:

### **`more` Command**
- **Functionality**: Displays the content of a file one screen at a time.
- **Navigation**: You can scroll forward screen-by-screen, but you cannot scroll backward.
- **Usage**: Simpler and works well for quick file previews.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  more filename.txt
  ```

### **`less` Command**
- **Functionality**: Allows you to view a file's content interactively, with both forward and backward navigation.
- **Navigation**:
  - Use **arrow keys** to scroll line-by-line.
  - Use **spacebar** to scroll page-by-page.
  - Use **b** to scroll backward.
- **Additional Features**: Supports search functionality using `/` for forward search and `?` for backward search.
- **Usage**: Preferred for large files or when you need advanced navigation options.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  less filename.txt
  ```

### Key Difference:
- **`more`**: Limited navigation; only forward scrolling.
- **`less`**: Flexible navigation; forward and backward scrolling, plus search capabilities.

The `head` and `tail` commands in Linux are used for viewing portions of a file, either from the beginning or the end. Here's how they work:

---

### **`head` Command**
- **Purpose**: Displays the first lines of a file.
- **Default Behavior**: Shows the first 10 lines of the file by default.
- **Syntax**:
  ```bash
  head [OPTIONS] FILE
  ```
- **Examples**:
  1. Display the first 10 lines of a file:
     ```bash
     head filename.txt
     ```
  2. Display the first 20 lines of a file:
     ```bash
     head -n 20 filename.txt
     ```

---

### **`tail` Command**
- **Purpose**: Displays the last lines of a file.
- **Default Behavior**: Shows the last 10 lines of the file by default.
- **Syntax**:
  ```bash
  tail [OPTIONS] FILE
  ```
- **Examples**:
  1. Display the last 10 lines of a file:
     ```bash
     tail filename.txt
     ```
  2. Display the last 15 lines of a file:
     ```bash
     tail -n 15 filename.txt
     ```
  3. Watch a file for real-time updates (useful for monitoring logs):
     ```bash
     tail -f filename.txt
     ```

### Key Differences:
| Command | Purpose                 | Default Behavior       | Use Case                              |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `head`  | View lines at the start | First 10 lines         | Quickly inspect the beginning of a file. |
| `tail`  | View lines at the end   | Last 10 lines          | Monitor logs or see recent updates in files. |
